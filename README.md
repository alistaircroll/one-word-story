# One Word Story

**One Word Story** is a collaborative multiplayer game where you and your friends write a story together—one (or a few) words at a time. 

It turns storytelling into a chaotic, hilarious, and unpredictable improvisational game. Perfect for parties, icebreakers, or killing time with friends, and a great way to help kids learn to read and write quickly.

## how to play

### 1. Start a Game
*   Click **"Create New Game"** on the home page.
*   You will be given a unique **6-character Room Code**.
*   Share this code with your friends so they can join your lobby.

### 2. Join a Game
*   Enter the **Room Code** provided by the host.
*   Enter your **Name**.
*   Wait in the lobby until everyone has arrived.

### 3. Gameplay
*   Once the host starts the game, the system will randomize the turn order.
*   When it's your turn, you have a limited time (default: 30 seconds) to add **exactly one word** to the story.
*   **Be quick!** If the timer runs out, your turn is skipped.
*   Watch the story unfold in real-time as your friends contribute their words.

### 4. Rules & Tips
*   **One Word Only:** You can only submit a single word per turn.
*   **Punctuation:** Basic punctuation marks (like `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`) are allowed and don't count as extra words. The game handles capitalization automatically.
*   **Don't Break the Chain:** Try to make your word flow naturally from the previous one.
*   **Fair Play:** The game ensures everyone gets an equal number of turns.
